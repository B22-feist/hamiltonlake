   <p> Hamilton lake or lake Rotoroa in maori has been in habitted by european from at least 1900. pre europen information on hamilton lake is sketchy but we know that the maori population collected freshwater clams and crayfish for eating. For european it is used for rectrational purpose throughout the 1900. The lake was used for swimming, sailing and physical events. In 1908 perch where released into the lake and grew substantially eventualy becoming a major source of fish in the lake. The lake was used throughout summer and many schools would swim in it and have competitions there. in the 1910 the amount of water in the lake was getting low and becoming a concern for the lake authroity, the water was drained as to facitliate the use of industry such as engines for the railway stations. After these problems contuined the lake authority brought legal action agianst the teh railway company and in chamber of commerce meeting it was agrred to stop draining the lake. In the end the lake authority agrred to purchases the land that hamilton lake was on from it's private owners. in 1959 the lake had sodium aresenite dumped in it. A number of event take place on hamilton Lake such as sailing, waka am (Maori rowwing) and dragon boats.
